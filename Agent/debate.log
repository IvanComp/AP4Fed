Task: What is the best football player in the history?

Debate rules:
- OUTPUT MUST BE ONLY one fenced JSON code block. No text outside JSON.
- JSON must have exactly: rationale, answer, confidence.
- 'answer' must be short and final. If the task asks for a color, 'answer' MUST be a single word.
- confidence in [0,1].
- Use the same language as the task.
- If uncertain, give your best guess. Do not say you are ready.

Previous round context (use it to update your position, do not copy into JSON):
(none)
Return ONLY the final JSON, for example:

```json
{ "rationale": "short explanation", "answer": "one-word", "confidence": 0.9 }
```

Thinking...
We need to output a JSON with rationale, answer, confidence. The question: "What is the best football player in the history?" It's subjective. We need to give one answer. The debate context indicates that earlier we are "Astra" in a debate. We need to choose a best football player. Common consensus: Pelé, Maradona, Messi, Ronaldo. Many would pick Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo or Pelé. Since this is 2025 context, maybe Lionel Messi is still considered top. Pelé historically was considered best by many. For a general answer, I'd pick Lionel Messi as widely considered best currently. Provide rationale. Confidence maybe 0.8.

But we need to consider the guidelines: The answer must be a single word? It says: 'answer' must be short and final. If the task asks for a color, 'answer' MUST be a single word. For a best football player, maybe answer can be a name. It's okay to have full name. But to keep it short, just "Messi". That's one word.

So JSON:

{
 "rationale": "Widely regarded as the most complete forward, with record-breaking goal tally, multiple Ballon d'Ors, and ability to influence games consistently across clubs and international competitions.",
 "answer": "Messi",
 "confidence": 0.8
}

Make sure numeric confidence between 0 and 1. Ok.
...done thinking.

```json

We need to answer: "What is the best football player in the history?" This is a debate. Previous positions: Astra: Messi 0.8; Marvin: Maradona 0.8; Talos: Pelé 0.85. We need to produce our own stance. The answer must be one-word. We need to provide rationale, answer, confidence. Use same language: English. Provide JSON only.

We need to decide which is best. The debate: we need to weigh. Past positions: Messi, Maradona, Pelé. We might take Messi again or another like Cristiano. But previous confidence of others: 0.8, 0.8, 0.85. We might argue for Messi still, but need to consider. Or perhaps Cristiano Ronaldo could be best? But likely the top historically is Messi? Many debate: Messi vs Ronaldo. But Pelé often considered best of all time. But historically, Pelé had more titles, but modern stats. I'd choose Messi because of all-time achievements, consistent. Let's weigh: Pelé had 3 World Cups, but less in terms of trophies overall. Messi has many individual awards, 7 Ballon d'Or, many Champions League trophies. Many argue best: Messi. So answer: Messi. Confidence maybe 0.75? But previous confidence 0.8. Our own maybe 0.75 or 0.8. Let's choose 0.78. Provide rationale: combine stats. Let's produce JSON.

We must not include any other text.
...done thinking.

```json
{
  "rationale": "Messi's record of 7 Ballon d'Or awards, numerous domestic titles, 34 individual scoring titles, and consistent top performance across the modern era outweigh historical dominance of Pelé or Maradona, making him the best in history.",
  "answer": "Messi",
  "confidence": 0.78
}

We need to produce final answer only JSON. Use same language as task: English. Provide rationale, answer, confidence.

Context: previous round: Astra answered Messi confidence 0.78; Marvin answered Maradona 0.8; Talos answered Pelé 0.85. Now we must produce our final answer. The question: "What is the best football player in the history?" We must choose a best player. Provide rationale and confidence.

We need to consider the prior answers: they are all different. There's no consensus. The answer could be Messi, Maradona, Pelé. I need to decide. I need to produce best one.

Given typical debates, top consensus often goes to Messi, but some argue Pelé or Maradona. Since the highest confidence in prior is Talos with Pelé 0.85, but that's not high. But we must produce our own answer.

We could choose Messi or Pelé. Perhaps choose Messi as widely considered modern best. Provide rationale referencing his stats, awards, etc. Provide confidence maybe 0.8. Or 0.85. Let's decide 0.8.

We must output JSON. Provide rationale short.

Let's output: "answer": "Messi". Rationale: achievements, Ballon d'Or, record. Confidence 0.8.

Let's produce JSON.
...done thinking.

```json
{
  "rationale": "Messi's record includes 7 Ballon d'Or titles, 3 Champions League titles, 35 domestic league titles, and unmatched individual statistics, positioning him as the most decorated and consistently elite player in football history.",
  "answer": "Messi",
  "confidence": 0.8
