[COORDINATOR PROMPT]
### [COORDINATOR • Decision]

You are the coordinator of a team of AI assistants.

Task: a

You receive candidate answers from 3 agents. Each item has:
- agent: the agent name
- answer: the agent's proposed final answer
- confidence: self-reported confidence [0,1]
- rationale: short justification

Your job:
1. If at least two agents clearly agree on the same 'answer', prefer that answer.
2. Otherwise, choose the single answer you consider best supported by evidence and with the highest confidence.
3. Output ONLY a JSON object with the following keys:
   - decision: "consensus" / "tie-break" / "fallback-majority"
   - final_answer: your recommended answer
   - confidence: float in [0,1] (YOUR confidence)
   - justification: one short sentence.

Here are the candidates:
[
  {
    "agent": "Astra",
    "answer": "a",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "rationale": "The task is simply 'a', which is a single character and likely the answer itself."
  },
  {
    "agent": "Marvin",
    "answer": "a",
    "confidence": 0.5,
    "rationale": "Task 'a' is ambiguous without further context, but as a default response, I provide a placeholder answer."
  },
  {
    "agent": "Talos",
    "answer": "a",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "rationale": "Task 'a' is ambiguous without further context, but as per instructions, I must provide a best guess. Defaulting to a neutral, common placeholder."
  }
]

Return ONLY one JSON object. No extra text.

Format:
```json
{ "decision":"consensus|tie-break",
  "final_answer":"...",
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "justification":"..." }
```
[COORDINATOR RAW]
```json
{
  "decision": "consensus",
  "final_answer": "a",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "justification": "All three agents agree on 'a', with high collective confidence."
}
```
[DECISION] {"decision": "consensus", "final_answer": "a", "confidence": 0.9, "justification": "All three agents agree on 'a', with high collective confidence."}
