[Agent 1] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b, temp=0.1): CS: OFF→OFF • MC: OFF→OFF • HDH: OFF→OFF
[Rationale A1] The system configuration shows two clients with identical CPU (5) and no non-IID data. The metrics indicate stable performance with no degradation. Activating any pattern would introduce overhead without clear benefit. Maintain current settings. CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF

[Agent 2] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b, temp=0.5): CS: OFF→OFF • MC: OFF→OFF • HDH: OFF→OFF
[Rationale A2] All architectural patterns are currently OFF. The system configuration shows two clients with identical CPU (5). There are no non-IID clients or data distribution issues, so activating Client Selector or Heterogeneous Data Handler would not be necessary. Message Compressor is not needed as communication time is already low and model size is small. Keeping all patterns OFF to minimize overhead and avoid potential negative impacts. CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF

[Agent 3] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b, temp=0.9): CS: OFF→OFF • MC: OFF→OFF • HDH: OFF→OFF
[Rationale A3] The system configuration indicates all clients have the same CPU and RAM (5 and 2 respectively). There is no observed trend in metrics to suggest optimization by Client Selector. Communication Time is already minimized, and the model is not large enough for compression to be effective. There is no non-IID data present, so Heterogeneous Data Handler is not needed. The previous configuration was OFF for all, and no compelling evidence to change.
CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF
