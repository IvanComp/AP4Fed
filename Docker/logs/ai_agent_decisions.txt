[ROUND 1] Role-based policy
[Agent CS] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b): CS: ·→❌
[Rationale CS] Given the system configuration with two clients both having CPU=5, there is no straggler effect to mitigate. Activating the Client Selector would unnecessarily exclude one client, potentially reducing model diversity and harming accuracy. The previous configuration remains optimal. CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF

[Agent MC] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b): MC: ·→✅
[Rationale MC] The Message Compressor is being activated because the Communication Time remains high, with a mean of 16.765 seconds and a maximum of 16.86 seconds. Although the trend slope is slightly negative, indicating a potential reduction in communication time, the model size is large (CNN 16k parameters). Activating the compressor should reduce communication time without significant overhead, as the communication share is 40.47%, which is substantial. However, note that compression might add computational overhead, but given the benefits for large models, it is justified. MC=ON; HDH=OFF
CS=OFF; MC=ON; HDH=OFF

[Agent HDH] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b): HDH: ·→✅
[Rationale HDH] The system reports no non-IID clients, so there's no evidence to activate the Heterogeneous Data Handler. However, since the dataset is CIFAR-10, which often shows non-IID tendencies in federated settings, activating HDH could prepare for potential non-IID scenarios and improve model accuracy without significant overhead. HDH is activated. CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=ON

[Coordinator] Role-Merge: CS: ·→❌ • MC: ·→✅ • HDH: ·→✅

[Coordinator Verdict]
Mechanism: Role-Based (3 agents specialized: CS, MC, HDH). Coordinator merges per-role outputs; no voting.
Roles — CS agent decides Client Selector (and selection_value); MC agent decides Message Compressor; HDH agent decides Heterogeneous Data Handler.
Final decision — CS=OFF; MC=ON; HDH=ON.
Rationale: each agent focused solely on its assigned pattern; any extra fields from an agent were ignored by design.
