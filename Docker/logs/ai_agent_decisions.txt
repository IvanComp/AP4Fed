[Rationale CS] The system configuration shows two clients with identical CPU (5) and no non-IID data. The metrics indicate stable performance with no clear bottleneck. Activating any pattern might introduce unnecessary overhead. Maintain current settings. CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF

[Rationale MC] The system configuration shows two clients with identical CPU (5) and no non-IID data. The metrics indicate stable performance with no clear bottleneck. Activating any pattern may introduce unnecessary overhead. Maintain current settings. CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF

[Rationale HDH] The system configuration shows two clients with identical CPU (5) and RAM (2). There is no evidence of straggler effect or data heterogeneity. The metrics indicate stable performance with no significant changes in training, communication, or total round times. Since the previous configuration was effective and there are no specific issues to address, keep all patterns OFF. CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF

[Coordinator Verdict]
Mechanism: Role-Based (3 agents specialized: CS, MC, HDH). Coordinator merges per-role outputs; no voting.
Roles — CS agent decides Client Selector (and selection_value); MC agent decides Message Compressor; HDH agent decides Heterogeneous Data Handler.
Final decision — CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF.
Rationale: each agent focused solely on its assigned pattern; any extra fields from an agent were ignored by design.
