[Rationale] Based on the provided system configuration and performance metrics, I recommend keeping all architectural patterns OFF. The dataset is FashionMNIST, which is relatively small, and the clients have similar CPU capabilities (all 5 or 3). The Client Selector pattern requires a threshold, and since the second-highest CPU is 5, setting a threshold would exclude clients with CPU 3, but there are two clients with CPU 3, so to avoid having fewer than two clients, the threshold must be less than 3. However, the Client Selector might not be necessary as the straggler effect is not severe given the similar CPU values. The Message Compressor could add overhead for small models like CNN 16k, and the Communication Time has been decreasing, suggesting it might not be needed. The Heterogeneous Data Handler is not necessary because the data distribution is mostly IID (2 out of 5 clients have IID data), and the model accuracy is not the primary concern here. The TrainingTime has a positive trend, indicating that the system is performing well without additional patterns. Therefore, to avoid unnecessary overhead, I keep all patterns OFF. CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF

== ROUND 2 ==
[Single-Agent] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b): CS: ❌→✅ • MC: ❌→✅ • HDH: ❌→✅
[Rationale] Based on the system configuration and performance metrics, I recommend activating the Client Selector with a selection_value of 4 to exclude clients with lower CPU capacity (3) and mitigate the straggler effect. This will reduce total round time by avoiding slow clients. Activating the Message Compressor will reduce communication time, especially since communication time has been high. The Heterogeneous Data Handler should be activated to address the non-IID data distribution, which can improve global model accuracy. The dataset is FashionMNIST, and there are 5 clients with varying CPUs and non-IID data. The TrainingTime has a high max (65.02s) and CommunicationTime has a high max (45.81s), indicating that reducing these could be beneficial. The previous configuration had all patterns OFF, and activating them now may improve performance. However, note that activating the Client Selector might reduce model diversity, but given the high straggler effect, it is necessary. The selection_value is set to 4, which is less than the second-highest CPU (5), ensuring at least two clients are active. The Client Selector, Message Compressor, and Heterogeneous Data Handler are all turned ON. CS=ON; MC=ON; HDH=ON
