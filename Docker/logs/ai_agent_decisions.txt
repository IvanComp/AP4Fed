== ROUND 1 ==
[Single-Agent] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b): CS: ·→❌ • MC: ·→❌ • HDH: ·→❌
[Rationale] Based on the provided system configuration and performance metrics, the Client Selector pattern is currently OFF. The clients have varying CPU capabilities, with some having 5 CPUs and others 3. Activating the Client Selector might exclude clients with lower CPUs, potentially reducing training time but risking model accuracy due to reduced diversity. However, the performance metrics show that the training time has been fluctuating, with a high maximum value of 64.97 seconds, indicating that stragglers might be affecting the round time. The Total Round Time has been consistently 99.96 seconds, suggesting that the round time is dominated by the client with the highest training time. Given that the system has 5 clients, and the second highest CPU is 5, setting the selection_value to 4 would include only clients with CPU >4, which are the ones with 5 CPUs. However, this would exclude the clients with 3 CPUs, which might be necessary to maintain diversity. Considering the metrics, the F1 score is not available, but the training time is high. The Client Selector might help reduce the round time by excluding slow clients, but it could also harm accuracy. The Message Compressor could reduce communication time, but the overhead might not be worth it for the FashionMNIST dataset, which is small. The Heterogeneous Data Handler is relevant because the data distribution is non-IID for some clients, but the performance metrics do not show any improvement in accuracy. Given the lack of clear evidence for improvement in accuracy and the potential overhead, it is safer to keep all patterns OFF. The rationale ends with: CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF.

== ROUND 2 ==
[Single-Agent] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b): CS: ❌→❌ • MC: ❌→❌ • HDH: ❌→❌
[Rationale] Based on the system configuration and performance metrics, the Client Selector, Message Compressor, and Heterogeneous Data Handler are currently OFF. The dataset is FashionMNIST, which is relatively small, and the model is a CNN with 16k parameters. The training time and communication time are high, but the primary concern is the high communication time and total round time. The Client Selector could reduce round time by excluding clients with low CPU, but the clients have CPUs of 5,5,5,3,3, so the second highest is 5, meaning all clients with CPU 5 would be included if set to 4, but since all have at least 3, and the second highest is 5, setting selection_value to 4 would include only clients with CPU>4, i.e., the three with 5, but there are three clients with 5 and two with 3. The second highest CPU is 5, so to avoid excluding more than necessary, the selection_value should be set to 4, which would include clients with CPU>4, i.e., the three clients with 5. However, the system requires at least two clients to be active, so three is acceptable. But the clients with low CPU might be the ones with delay, and excluding them might not be necessary if the model is converging. The Message Compressor could reduce communication time, but the communication time is already high, and the model is not too large, so the overhead might not be worth it. The Heterogeneous Data Handler is for non-IID data, but the data distribution is 3 NON-IID and 2 IID, so it might be beneficial, but the training time is high, and the pattern adds overhead. Given the current metrics, the previous configuration was OFF, and there is no strong evidence to change it. Therefore, I keep all patterns OFF to avoid unnecessary overhead. The rationale ends with CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF.

== ROUND 3 ==
[Single-Agent] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b): CS: ❌→❌ • MC: ❌→❌ • HDH: ❌→❌
[Rationale] Based on the current system configuration and evaluation metrics, the Client Selector, Message Compressor, and Heterogeneous Data Handler remain OFF. The dataset is FashionMNIST, which is relatively small and IID, so the Heterogeneous Data Handler is not needed. The training time and communication time are high, but the previous round had similar metrics, and activating the Client Selector might reduce diversity and accuracy. The Message Compressor could reduce communication time, but the trend shows communication time is decreasing, and the overhead might not be worth it. The Client Selector is OFF to keep all clients, ensuring model diversity. The previous configuration was OFF for all, and there is no strong evidence to change. Therefore, we keep the previous settings. CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF

== ROUND 4 ==
[Single-Agent] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b): CS: ❌→❌ • MC: ❌→❌ • HDH: ❌→❌
[Rationale] Based on the current system configuration and performance metrics, the Client Selector, Message Compressor, and Heterogeneous Data Handler are currently OFF. The dataset is FashionMNIST, which is relatively small, and the clients have varying CPU capabilities. However, the performance metrics show that the TrainingTime has a high variance (min 16.89, max 102.13) and the last TrainingTime was 102.13 seconds, which is high. The CommunicationTime has a lower variance (min 10.51, max 64.52) and the last value was 28.01 seconds. The TotalRoundTime last round was 132.63 seconds. The data distribution is NON-IID for 3 clients, which might benefit from the Heterogeneous Data Handler to mitigate non-IID effects. However, activating the Heterogeneous Data Handler would increase local computation time, which might not be beneficial given the TrainingTime already has a high maximum. The Client Selector could help reduce the impact of stragglers by selecting clients with higher CPU, but the clients have CPUs of 5,5,5,3,3, so the second highest CPU is 5, meaning if we set selection_value to 4, then only clients with CPU >4 would be selected, which are the three clients with CPU 5. This would leave only three clients, but the system requires at least two clients to be active, so it is allowed. However, excluding the clients with CPU 3 might reduce diversity and accuracy. The Message Compressor might reduce CommunicationTime, but the CommunicationTime already has a low trend_slope and the TrainingTime is high, so it might not be worth the overhead. Given the lack of clear evidence to change the configuration, I will keep all patterns OFF to avoid unnecessary overhead. CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF

== ROUND 5 ==
[Single-Agent] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b): CS: ❌→✅ • MC: ❌→✅ • HDH: ❌→✅
[Rationale] Based on the system configuration and performance metrics, I recommend activating the Client Selector with a selection_value of 4 to exclude clients with lower CPU capacity, thereby reducing the impact of stragglers and improving round time. Activating the Message Compressor will reduce communication time, and the Heterogeneous Data Handler will address non-IID data issues, improving model accuracy. The configuration shows clients with CPU 5 are faster, and the last round had high training and communication times, so these patterns should be activated. The selection_value is set to 4, which is less than the second-highest CPU (5), ensuring at least two clients are active. The previous state was all OFF, so we are activating all patterns. The rationale ends with the signature line: CS=ON; MC=ON; HDH=ON.

== ROUND 6 ==
[Single-Agent] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b): CS: ❌→❌ • MC: ❌→❌ • HDH: ❌→❌
[Rationale] Based on the provided system configuration and performance metrics, I recommend keeping all architectural patterns OFF. The dataset is FashionMNIST, which is relatively small and simple, and the clients have varying CPU capabilities. However, the performance metrics show that the training time has been increasing over recent rounds, with a trend slope of 4.5967 for training time and 0.775 for communication time. The last round's training time was 151.96 seconds, which is high, and the communication time was 30.9 seconds. The Client Selector pattern could help reduce training time by excluding slower clients, but the clients' CPUs are [5,5,5,3,3], and the second highest CPU is 5, so setting selection_value to 4 would exclude the two clients with CPU 3, leaving three clients with CPU 5. However, activating Client Selector might reduce diversity and harm accuracy. The Message Compressor could reduce communication time, but the model size is small (CNN 16k), and the overhead might not be worth it. The Heterogeneous Data Handler is designed for non-IID data, but the data distribution is mixed (3 NON-IID and 2 IID clients). Given the increasing training time, it might be better to keep the system simple and avoid introducing overhead. Therefore, I recommend keeping all patterns OFF to avoid unnecessary complexity and potential degradation in performance. CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF

== ROUND 7 ==
[Single-Agent] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b): CS: ✅→✅ • MC: ✅→✅ • HDH: ✅→✅
[Rationale] Based on the system configuration and performance metrics, I recommend keeping all architectural patterns active. The Client Selector is already ON with a selection_value of 4, which ensures that clients with CPU > 4 are selected. Given the client CPU values [5, 5, 5, 3, 3], this selection_value is appropriate as it excludes the two clients with CPU 3, leaving three clients with CPU 5. This helps mitigate the straggler effect by excluding slower clients, reducing round time. The Message Compressor is ON, which reduces communication time, and the Heterogeneous Data Handler is ON, which addresses non-IID data issues. The performance metrics show that the last round had a TrainingTime of 33.08 seconds, CommunicationTime of 9.3 seconds, and TotalRoundTime of 374.1 seconds. While the TrainingTime has been decreasing over the rounds (trend_slope -0.317), the CommunicationTime has also been decreasing (trend_slope -0.111), suggesting that the patterns are having a positive effect. However, the TotalRoundTime is still high, and the patterns are contributing to reducing it. The F1 score is not available in the last round, but the patterns are designed to improve accuracy. Given the benefits, I recommend keeping all patterns active. CS=ON; MC=ON; HDH=ON

== ROUND 8 ==
[Single-Agent] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b): CS: ❌→❌ • MC: ❌→❌ • HDH: ❌→❌
[Rationale] Based on the current system configuration and evaluation metrics, the previous settings are maintained. The Client Selector is currently OFF, and there is no strong evidence to activate it despite the presence of clients with varying CPU capabilities. The data distribution shows 3 NON-IID clients out of 5, but the previous round's metrics do not indicate a significant straggler effect. The TrainingTime and CommunicationTime metrics show high variability, but the trend slopes are not alarming. The F1 score is not provided in the latest report, so we cannot assess model accuracy improvement. The Message Compressor and Heterogeneous Data Handler are OFF, and there is no indication of large models or high communication overhead to justify their activation. The CPU values are all relatively high (5,5,5,3,3), and the second highest is 5, so setting a selection_value might exclude too many clients. Therefore, keeping all patterns OFF is the safest choice to avoid unnecessary overhead and potential accuracy loss. CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF

== ROUND 9 ==
[Single-Agent] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b): CS: ✅→✅ • MC: ✅→✅ • HDH: ✅→✅
[Rationale] Based on the system configuration and performance metrics, I recommend keeping all architectural patterns active. The Client Selector is already ON with a selection_value of 4, which ensures that only clients with CPU > 4 (i.e., the three clients with 5 CPUs) are selected. This helps mitigate the straggler effect by excluding the two clients with lower CPU (3), which have been causing longer training times. The Message Compressor is active and helps reduce communication time, which is beneficial given the high communication time observed. The Heterogeneous Data Handler is active and addresses non-IID data, which is present in the dataset. The performance metrics show that the training time has been increasing, so excluding slower clients might help reduce training time. However, the F1 score is not available, so we rely on other metrics. The last round's training time was 107.13 seconds, which is high, and the trend slope is positive, indicating an increase. The communication time has been decreasing slightly, so the compressor might be effective. Given the benefits and the fact that the system is already using these patterns, I recommend keeping them active. CS=ON; MC=ON; HDH=ON
