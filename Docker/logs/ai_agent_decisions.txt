== ROUND 1 ==
[Single-Agent] Decision (deepseek-r1:1.5b): CS: ❌→✅ • MC: ❌→✅ • HDH: ❌→✅
[Single-Agent] Rationale (deepseek-r1:1.5b): The input shows that the active patterns are OFF for all components, which is not ideal. This suggests that each component should be activated to optimize performance and efficiency in the federated learning system.
[Single AI-Agent (Zero-Shot)] PolicyTime: 1.08s


== ROUND 2 ==
[Single-Agent] Decision (deepseek-r1:1.5b): CS: ✅→❌ • MC: ✅→❌ • HDH: ✅→❌
[Single-Agent] Rationale (deepseek-r1:1.5b): The communication time is 20.2575 seconds, which is less than the total time of 50.13 seconds and training time of 27.14 seconds. Therefore, all components should be OFF.
[Single AI-Agent (Zero-Shot)] PolicyTime: 1.17s


== ROUND 3 ==
[Single-Agent] Decision (deepseek-r1:1.5b): CS: ❌→✅ • MC: ❌→✅ • HDH: ❌→✅
[Single-Agent] Rationale (deepseek-r1:1.5b): The input shows that the active patterns are OFF across all components, which is not ideal. Therefore, we should activate each component to ensure proper communication and efficient training. This would be particularly important in this case because the mean_f1 score is relatively low compared to the other metrics.
[Single AI-Agent (Zero-Shot)] PolicyTime: 1.37s


== ROUND 4 ==
[Single-Agent] Decision (deepseek-r1:1.5b): CS: ✅→❌ • MC: ✅→❌ • HDH: ✅→❌
[Single-Agent] Rationale (deepseek-r1:1.5b): The communication time dominates over the total time, so we should prioritize reducing the amount of data communicated between clients and the server. This can be achieved by turning off client_selector, message_compressor, and heterogeneous_data_handler to minimize overall communication overhead.
[Single AI-Agent (Zero-Shot)] PolicyTime: 1.19s
