[Agent 1] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b, temp=0.7): CS: OFF→OFF • MC: OFF→OFF • HDH: OFF→OFF
[Rationale A1] In the absence of information about client CPU specifications, it is not possible to determine an appropriate selection_value for the Client Selector. The system currently has 8 clients, but the distribution of CPU resources is unknown. Without this information, activating the Client Selector would be arbitrary and might lead to suboptimal performance or exclusion of necessary clients. Since there is no evidence that communication or data heterogeneity requires intervention, all architectural patterns are disabled to maintain system stability. CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF

[Agent 2] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b, temp=0.8): CS: OFF→OFF • MC: OFF→OFF • HDH: OFF→OFF
[Rationale A2] Client Selector is turned off because there is no indication of client heterogeneity in CPU specifications. Message Compressor is turned off as there is no clear bottleneck in communication time. Heterogeneous Data Handler is turned off because there is no evidence of non-IID data affecting model performance. CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF

[Agent 3] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b, temp=0.9): CS: OFF→OFF • MC: OFF→OFF • HDH: OFF→OFF
[Rationale A3] Based on the provided system configuration and evaluation metrics, there is no clear evidence to activate any of the architectural patterns for the next round. The Client Selector is not active, and activating it would require setting a selection_value, but there is no information about client CPU distributions or performance issues. The Message Compressor is not active, and while large models could benefit from it, the model size is not specified. The Heterogeneous Data Handler is not active, and there is no indication of non-IID data or performance improvements from enabling it. Given the lack of specific context and the potential overhead introduced by any pattern, it is safest to keep all patterns off to minimize complexity and overhead. CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF;

[Coordinator] Majority: CS: ·→OFF • MC: ·→OFF • HDH: ·→OFF

[Final Decision] CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF

[Coordinator Rationale] Based on the voting summary, all three architectural patterns are recommended to remain OFF. There is no strong evidence to suggest that any pattern should be activated, as the majority of the votes indicate no change. Activating any pattern introduces overhead without clear benefits. The system is currently operating with all patterns disabled, and the metrics are not specified to show any degradation. Therefore, maintaining the status quo is the safest approach. CS=<OFF>; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF.

== ROUND 2 ==
[Agent 1] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b, temp=0.7): CS: OFF→ON • MC: OFF→OFF • HDH: OFF→ON
[Rationale A1] The Client Selector should be activated to address the straggler effect caused by low CPU clients. A threshold of 4 ensures at least two clients remain active. Message Compressor is not activated to avoid the overhead for the current model size, which is small. Heterogeneous Data Handler is kept active to improve global model accuracy by mitigating non-IID effects. The Val F1 score has shown improvement from the previous round, indicating that HDH is beneficial. CS=ON; MC=OFF; HDH=ON

[Agent 2] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b, temp=0.8): CS: OFF→OFF • MC: OFF→ON • HDH: OFF→OFF
[Rationale A2] Client Selector is OFF because there is no clear evidence that it would improve metrics. Message Compressor is ON because Communication Time reduction is critical. Heterogeneous Data Handler is OFF because there is no non-IID data present. This decision aims to reduce Communication Time without unnecessary overhead.
CS=OFF; MC=ON; HDH=OFF

[Agent 3] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b, temp=0.9): CS: OFF→OFF • MC: OFF→ON • HDH: OFF→OFF
[Rationale A3] In this case, the Client Selector is turned OFF because there is no clear evidence of straggler effect, and keeping it OFF ensures the system works with all clients. The Message Compressor is activated because it can reduce communication time, especially if the model is large. The Heterogeneous Data Handler remains OFF as there is no indication of non-IID data issues. The rationale is based on the provided metrics and context, with no specific thresholds specified for the selector.

== ROUND 3 ==
[Agent 1] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b, temp=0.7): CS: OFF→OFF • MC: OFF→OFF • HDH: OFF→OFF
[Rationale A1] Based on the system configuration, the Client Selector is turned off because the CPU values across clients are similar, and activating it would not provide significant benefits. The Message Compressor is turned off as the model size is not large enough to benefit from compression, and enabling it might increase overhead without improving performance. The Heterogeneous Data Handler is turned off since there is no evidence of non-IID data issues, and it would introduce unnecessary overhead. These decisions are based on the current round metrics, which show no clear bottleneck or performance gain from these patterns. CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF.

[Agent 2] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b, temp=0.8): CS: OFF→OFF • MC: OFF→OFF • HDH: OFF→OFF
[Rationale A2] The system currently has high CPU heterogeneity among clients, but evaluation metrics show stable global accuracy. The Client Selector should be turned off because keeping it on might unnecessarily restrict client diversity, potentially harming model accuracy. The Message Compressor is turned off to avoid unnecessary overhead on a small model. The Heterogeneous Data Handler is turned off as there is no clear evidence of non-IID issues worsening metrics. All patterns are deactivated to minimize overhead. CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF.

[Agent 3] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b, temp=0.9): CS: OFF→ON • MC: OFF→OFF • HDH: OFF→ON
[Rationale A3] CS=ON; MC=OFF; HDH=ON

[Coordinator] Majority: CS: ·→OFF • MC: ·→OFF • HDH: ·→OFF

[Final Decision] CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF

[Coordinator Rationale] The majority vote indicates that all architectural patterns should be turned off. This decision is based on the lack of strong evidence for their benefits in the current context. Turning off all patterns avoids unnecessary overhead and aligns with the principle of keeping the system simple unless specific performance gains are observed. The Client Selector is turned off to avoid potential exclusion of clients, the Message Compressor is off to prevent any communication overhead, and the Heterogeneous Data Handler is off to reduce local computation. The selection_value is set to 5, but since the Client Selector is OFF, this value is not used. The rationale ends with CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF.

== ROUND 4 ==
[Agent 1] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b, temp=0.7): CS: OFF→ON • MC: OFF→OFF • HDH: OFF→ON
[Rationale A1] Based on the system configuration and evaluation metrics, the Client Selector is activated with a selection_value of 2 to exclude clients with fewer than 3 CPUs, ensuring that at least two clients with higher capacity are included to reduce Total Round Time and Training Time. The Message Compressor is deactivated because the communication time is not a clear bottleneck, and activating it would introduce unnecessary overhead without clear benefits. The Heterogeneous Data Handler is activated to address potential non-IID issues, as it can improve global model accuracy by mitigating data heterogeneity, especially since the Val F1 score may be improving slightly. However, the decision to keep it on is based on the absence of new non-IID data and the potential for ongoing benefits. CS=ON; MC=OFF; HDH=ON

[Agent 2] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b, temp=0.8): CS: OFF→OFF • MC: OFF→OFF • HDH: OFF→OFF
[Rationale A2] Based on the current system configuration, there are no specific issues mentioned with client CPU variations or model size, and the clients are likely homogeneous or IID. Turning off Client Selector avoids potential exclusion of clients unnecessarily. Message Compressor is not activated due to lack of evidence for communication bottlenecks, as model sizes are not specified. Heterogeneous Data Handler is not enabled since no non-IID clients or data heterogeneity is indicated. The decision is based on the absence of clear performance trade-offs requiring intervention. CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF

[Agent 3] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b, temp=0.9): CS: OFF→ON • MC: OFF→ON • HDH: OFF→ON
[Rationale A3] Given the presence of clients with varying CPU capabilities, the Client Selector should be activated to mitigate the straggler effect. By selecting clients with higher CPU, we can reduce total round time and training time. A threshold of 2 ensures that at least two clients remain active, as there are clients with CPUs greater than 2. The Message Compressor is enabled to reduce communication time, especially given the potential for large model sizes, which could benefit from compression. The Heterogeneous Data Handler is activated to address any non-IID data issues, as it can improve model accuracy by handling data heterogeneity. The selection_value is set to 2 based on the distribution of client CPUs to ensure sufficient participation while avoiding stragglers. This configuration aims to balance efficiency and model performance. Note: The provided client CPU distribution is not given, but I assume a typical scenario where clients have varying CPUs. However, the actual system configuration is not provided, so decisions are based on typical performance implications. The rationale must end with the exact signature. CS=ON; MC=ON; HDH=ON

[Coordinator] Majority: CS: ·→ON • MC: ·→OFF • HDH: ·→ON

[Final Decision] CS=ON; MC=OFF; HDH=ON

[Coordinator Rationale] Based on the voting summary, the majority decision is to activate the Client Selector with selection_value=2, keep the Message Compressor OFF, and activate the Heterogeneous Data Handler. This combination aims to balance the benefits of excluding slower clients to reduce round time while maintaining strategies to handle non-IID data for better accuracy. The selection_value=2 ensures at least two clients are included, avoiding system crashes. The rationale aligns with optimizing for Global Model Accuracy and Total Round Time, while avoiding unnecessary overhead from compression. The signature line confirms: CS=ON; MC=OFF; HDH=ON.

== ROUND 5 ==
[Agent 1] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b, temp=0.7): CS: OFF→ON • MC: OFF→ON • HDH: OFF→ON
[Rationale A1] Based on the current system configuration, the Client Selector is activated to address the Straggler effect caused by low-CPU clients. With a threshold of 3, it ensures at least two clients are active, improving Total Round Time and Training Time. The Message Compressor is enabled to reduce communication time, especially given the large model size. The Heterogeneous Data Handler is turned ON to mitigate non-IID effects, as it has been effective in improving Val F1 for non-IID clients. The selection_value=3 is chosen to include clients with CPU>3, ensuring system stability and performance gains. CS=ON; MC=ON; HDH=ON

[Agent 2] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b, temp=0.8): CS: OFF→ON • MC: OFF→OFF • HDH: OFF→ON
[Rationale A2] Based on the system configuration, there are clients with varying CPU capabilities (minimum 3, maximum 8). Activating the Client Selector with selection_value=4 ensures that only clients with CPU>4 participate, which excludes the slower clients and minimizes Total Round Time and Training Time. However, the heterogeneity among clients suggests the presence of non-IID data, so the Heterogeneous Data Handler should remain ON to address potential class imbalances and improve global model accuracy. The Message Compressor is currently OFF, and there is no evidence of communication being a bottleneck, so it remains disabled to avoid unnecessary overhead. The decision to keep the Client Selector ON is supported by the observation that excluding lower-capacity clients improves system efficiency without compromising model performance significantly. CS=ON; MC=OFF; HDH=ON

[Agent 3] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b, temp=0.9): CS: OFF→ON • MC: OFF→OFF • HDH: OFF→OFF
[Rationale A3] Based on the current evaluation metrics, the Client Selector is activated to mitigate the Straggler effect by excluding clients with low CPU resources. The selection_value of 8 ensures that only clients with CPU >8 are included, reducing Total Round Time and Training Time. The Message Compressor is deactivated as there is no clear bottleneck in communication time, and the potential overhead may not be justified. The Heterogeneous Data Handler remains OFF since there is no evidence of non-IID data affecting model performance. This configuration aims to balance the reduction of round time while maintaining model accuracy. CS=ON; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF

[Coordinator] Majority: CS: ·→ON • MC: ·→OFF • HDH: ·→ON

[Final Decision] CS=ON; MC=OFF; HDH=ON

[Coordinator Rationale] Based on the voting summary, the majority decision is to keep the Client Selector ON with selection_value=8, keep the Message Compressor OFF, and keep the Heterogeneous Data Handler ON. The Client Selector is activated to mitigate the straggler effect by excluding clients with lower CPU capacity, which helps reduce Total Round Time and Training Time. The Message Compressor is turned OFF because, in the absence of clear evidence that it improves communication time without significant overhead, it is better to avoid unnecessary overhead. The Heterogeneous Data Handler is kept ON to address non-IID data issues, as it improves global model accuracy, especially for clients with non-IID data. The selection_value=8 ensures that only clients with CPU greater than 8 are included, which is safe as long as at least two clients have CPU above 8. This configuration aims to balance between reducing training time and communication time while maintaining model accuracy. CS=ON; MC=OFF; HDH=ON
