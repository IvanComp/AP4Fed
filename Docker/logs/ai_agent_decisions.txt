[Agent 1] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b, temp=0.1): CS: OFF→OFF • MC: OFF→OFF • HDH: OFF→OFF
[Rationale A1] The system configuration shows two clients with identical CPU (5) and no non-IID data or delays. The metrics indicate stable performance with no clear bottleneck. Activating any pattern might introduce unnecessary overhead without proven benefit. Maintain current settings. CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF

[Agent 2] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b, temp=0.5): CS: OFF→OFF • MC: OFF→OFF • HDH: OFF→OFF
[Rationale A2] All architectural patterns are currently OFF. The system configuration shows 2 clients with identical CPU (5), and the dataset is IID. There is no evidence of non-IID data or communication bottlenecks. Keeping all patterns OFF minimizes overhead and maintains the current performance. Client Selector is not necessary as all clients have the same CPU, and activating it would require a threshold less than 5, but excluding any client could harm model diversity. Message Compressor and Heterogeneous Data Handler are not indicated by the IID data and balanced CPU. CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF

[Agent 3] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b, temp=0.9): CS: OFF→OFF • MC: OFF→OFF • HDH: OFF→OFF
[Rationale A3] All architectural patterns are currently OFF. The current system configuration has two clients with identical CPU capabilities (5 each). There are no indications of straggler effects or heterogeneity in data distribution. The dataset is IID, so no need to activate the Heterogeneous Data Handler. Communication time and total round time metrics are stable with no clear opportunity to improve by enabling compression or client selection. Therefore, keep all patterns OFF. CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF

[Coordinator] Majority: CS: ·→OFF • MC: ·→OFF • HDH: ·→OFF

[Coordinator Rationale] All three proposals unanimously vote to keep all architectural patterns OFF. The system configuration shows two clients with identical CPU (5) and IID data, with stable performance metrics. Majority baseline also supports OFF. Activating any pattern would introduce unnecessary overhead without clear benefit, as there are no signs of heterogeneity, stragglers, or communication bottlenecks. Therefore, maintain current settings.
CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF
[Coordinator] LLM consulted. Majority kept to preserve current behavior.
