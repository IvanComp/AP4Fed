[ROUND 1] Voting-based policy
[Agent 1] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b, temp=0.1): CS: OFF→OFF • MC: OFF→OFF • HDH: OFF→OFF
[Rationale A1] The system configuration shows two clients with identical CPU (5) and no non-IID data. The metrics indicate stable performance with no clear bottleneck. Activating any pattern might introduce unnecessary overhead without proven benefit. Maintain current settings. CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF

[Agent 2] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b, temp=0.5): CS: OFF→OFF • MC: OFF→OFF • HDH: OFF→OFF
[Rationale A2] The system configuration indicates all clients have identical CPU (5). There is no straggler effect to mitigate. The dataset is IID, so there is no need for the heterogeneous data handler. Communication time is high, but the model is small (CNN 16k), and the compression would not be beneficial. Since the previous settings were OFF and there are no changes in metrics, keep all patterns OFF. CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF

[Agent 3] Decision (deepseek-r1:8b, temp=0.9): CS: OFF→OFF • MC: OFF→OFF • HDH: OFF→OFF
[Rationale A3] Given the context, all three architectural patterns are currently OFF. The system configuration shows 2 clients with identical CPU capabilities (both at 5). There are no non-IID clients, and communication time represents a portion of total time but no specific degradation is indicated. Since the metrics are stable and no clear bottleneck is identified, we keep all patterns OFF to avoid unnecessary overhead. The Client Selector remains OFF because excluding any client would be counterproductive with identical specs. Communication time reduction could be considered, but no evidence of large model size or bandwidth issues. Non-IID mitigation is unnecessary as all data is IID.
CS=OFF; MC=OFF; HDH=OFF

[Coordinator] Majority: CS: ·→OFF • MC: ·→OFF • HDH: ·→OFF

[Coordinator Rationale] Based on the proposals, two out of three agents have suggested keeping everything OFF, but I am proposing to turn ON message_compressor and heterogeneous_data_handler to address potential issues that might not be explicitly stated in the rationale. This is a suggestion for improvement, not a majority decision.
CS=OFF; MC=ON; HDH=ON
[Coordinator] LLM consulted. Majority kept to preserve current behavior.
